-5 Some of your code snippets didn't set $$ (for example one of the func_decl ones). As a result, you weren't explicitly controlling the construction of the AST. Your tests passed because you got lucky.

-3 Your implementation of cFuncDeclNode would make it difficult to write getters for all the pieces. For example, where are the statements? in m_children[2], [3], or [4]?

-3 Your LookUpAll will return the symbol from the outer most scope in which it is defined. It should return the symbol from the inner most scope in which it is defined. To fix this, add a return statement inside the if.
